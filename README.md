# -Spring-framework_-Phase-II
In recent days, I feel very panic and uneasy. The stone hanging in my heart has not landed yet. God, help me. You know what I want. I didn't go to the class meeting yesterday. I just want to get out of here as soon as possible, get rid of the relationship with this school and all the people here. Programming is too difficult. The learning atmosphere in this school is very bad. In addition to many abnormal ideas derived from such a difficult form of employment in China. I don't know why it's deja vu. Help me. God, now I'm in the library. I can't learn. I can't leave so early. Sheffield refused me again. I can only write another argue letter. There's no way. The school is really terrible. I'm really helpless. I also know where my IQ is, so I can only keep learning and keep learning to survive in the environment of Shanghai. I have no other way to choose. When did I become like this? Maybe I was like this. I was helpless. I thought that someone wouldn't really like programming. I was a little speechless. That's it. There's nothing to say. May God be with me
